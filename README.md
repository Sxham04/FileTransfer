# P2P File Transfer System (Java)

A peer-to-peer file sharing application where a **File Owner** splits a large file into smaller 100KB chunks, and **Peers** collaborate to share those chunks until everyone has the full file.

## How it Works

1. **FileOwner**: Splits the source file and distributes an initial set of chunks to each connecting peer.
2. **Peers**:
* Connect to the **FileOwner** to get their first pieces.
* Connect to a **Neighbor Peer** to exchange missing chunks.
* Once all chunks are collected, the peer merges them back into the original file.

## Setup & Execution

### 1. Compile the Source Code

Open your terminal in the project directory and compile both files:

```powershell
javac FileOwner.java
cd peer1
java Peer1.java

cd peer2
java Peer2.java

```

### 2. Start the File Owner

Run the owner and provide the path to the file you want to share:

```powershell
java FileOwner

```

* **Port**: Defaults to `5000`.
* **Action**: Enter the file name (e.g., `document.pdf`) when prompted.

### 3. Start the Peers

Open a new terminal for each peer. Use the following format:
`java Peer <OwnerPort> <SelfPort> <NeighborPort>`

To create a working "Ring" network of 5 peers, run these commands:

Terminal | Command 
**Peer 1** `java Peer 5000 5001 5002` 
**Peer 2** `java Peer 5000 5002 5003` 
**Peer 3** `java Peer 5000 5003 5004` 
**Peer 4** `java Peer 5000 5004 5005` 
**Peer 5** `java Peer 5000 5005 5001`

## File Structure

* `FileOwner.java`: The server that initiates the file seeding.
* `Peer.java`: The client/server hybrid that downloads and uploads chunks.
* `ChunkIDList.txt`: Generated by each peer to track which parts they own.
* `[Numbered Files]`: Temporary 100KB chunks (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`) saved during transfer.

## Important Notes

* **Neighbor Connection**: If a peer starts before its neighbor, it will show "Cannot connect to peer." This is normal; it will automatically retry every second until the neighbor is online.
* **Completion**: When a peer prints `Enters merging`, check the folder for the successfully reconstructed file.
